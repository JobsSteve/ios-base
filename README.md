# rg-ios-base
iOS Base - project with pre-settings, well-organised and best-practices for quickly starting the new project.

**Issues:**

1. Structure code by groups.
2. Structure code inside project with pragma marks.
3. CocoaPods for using third party libraries.
4. Podfile with recommended libs.
5. Worker Categories.
6. Helpers in .pch file.
7. .gitignore file.
8. Debug Logging. DLog.
9. Images.xcassets.
10. Treat “Warnings” as errors. (How hide warnings in XCode).
11. Schemes: staging vs production (icons, app_ids, bundles).
11. Documented code.
12. Crittercism (crash reports).
13. Magical Record + MOGenerator.
14. Script. (Automatically push build to TestFlight).
15. Unit tests.
16. Automation tests.
17. TravisCI, Continuous Integration.
18. CodeStyle.
19. Store secrets and tokens.
20. Controller hierarchy. (Rules of design on paper).
